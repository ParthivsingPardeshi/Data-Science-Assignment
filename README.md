# Data Science Assignments

This repository contains various assignments for the **Data Science** course in the MCA 2nd semester. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of data analysis, preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning.

## Directory Structure

- **Assignment1.ipynb**: 
  - Focuses on preprocessing internet usage data, handling missing values, detecting/removing outliers, and visualizing trends using Python objects and plots.
  
- **Assignment2.ipynb**: 
  - Demonstrates handling missing values using loops and vectorization, removing outliers using Z-score and IQR methods, and visualizing internet usage trends with line and bar plots.

- **Assignment3.ipynb**: 
  - Covers advanced outlier detection using Z-score and IQR methods, exporting processed data, and visualizing data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- **Assignment20.ipynb**: 
  - Focuses on preprocessing quarterly gold demand data, removing outliers, and performing K-means clustering to identify patterns.

- **Assignment21.ipynb**: 
  - Preprocesses yearly gold demand data, normalizes features, and applies logistic regression for binary classification. Includes evaluation metrics and ROC curve visualization.

- **Assignment22.ipynb**: 
  - Analyzes gold demand by sector, removes outliers using Z-score, and applies decision tree regression for predictive modeling.

- **Assignment23.ipynb**: 
  - Explores gold jewelry demand by country, removes outliers using IQR, and applies Random Forest regression. Includes feature importance visualization.

- **Assignment24.ipynb**: 
  - Analyzes gold reserves data, preprocesses features for neural network training, and builds a neural network model using scikit-learn. Includes evaluation metrics and prediction visualization.

## Prerequisites
